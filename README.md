# `psynlp` --- fork of original package adapted for detecting sentences containing a moment of change in clinical psychiatry notes

See the original psynlp package https://github.com/vmenger/psynlp for documentation, and some very nice examples and tutorials. The folder NLPpipeline contains the code for a pipeline with several consecutive filters for selecting sentences (in Dutch) containing phrases about four mental health outcome measures and change indicators. The code in this folder uses the modified psynlp package forked in this repository.
